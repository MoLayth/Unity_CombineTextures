# Unity_CombineTextures
A Unity Editor tool for combining multiple grayscale textures (Roughness, Metallic, Emission, Alpha) into a single packed texture using a Custom Render Texture workflow. It provides a simple UI with drag‑and‑drop slots, resolution options, and automatic folder processing to streamline texture channel packing.
